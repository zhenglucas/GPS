# GPS
The use of graph theory to reduce the complexity of surface reaction network
# Note
The "get_intermediates.py" is used for the generation of intermediates for a end-to-end reaction with the SMILES representation.
The "creat_adsorption_configurations.py" is used for the  adsorption configurations enumeration of a specific intermedites. The input is SMILES representation of the intermediate and a POSCAR file of the slab model.
The "class_regre_ml_model.py" is the mechine learning model for the reduction of the complexity when exploring the reaction network to get the most likely reaction pathway.
The "package" includes some basic functions for the above three main functions.
